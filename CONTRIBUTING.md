## 🏦 Adding a New Bank

The list of banks is automatically updated daily using the [MergeTool](https://github.com/guibranco/BancosBrasileiros-MergeTool).  

However, if the tool cannot find the data for a specific bank, you can help by:  
1. Opening a **Bug Report** issue.  
2. Including all the necessary details about the bank, such as:
   - Bank name  
   - Code  
   - Country or region  
   - Any additional relevant data  

We will manually add the bank to the JSON file and ensure it is included in future updates. ✅

## 🗑️ Removing a Bank

If a bank needs to be removed (e.g., it no longer exists or merged with another), you can:  
1. Open a **Bug Report** issue.  
2. Include the following details:
   - The name and code of the bank to be removed.  
   - The reason for its removal (e.g., discontinued, merged).  
   - Supporting evidence or links to verify the request.  

We’ll handle the removal manually in the JSON file and update the project accordingly. 🔄

## 🔍 Adding a New Source of Data

2. Include the following details:
   - 📂 The type of data the source provides.  
   - 🔗 A link to the source (if applicable).  
   - 📜 Any requirements, licenses, or permissions to use the data.  

Make sure the source aligns with the project’s goals and standards. 🌟
